# LinkedListsTicketReservation
A program with a robust "doubly + down" 2D Linked-list searching algorithm that will find a seating selection closest to the midpoint of a 2D grid.
By using a linkedlist, we eliminate redundant movement of nodes inherent to an ArrayList, and inserting or deleting nodes becomes fast and efficient.

To test this program, create a text file like something of the following format:

```.AAAAAAAA....AAAAAA.   
.CCS..CSS.A.AAAA.AC.   
AAC.SS.ACCC..AACCSS.  
.ACCSSAACS.S.ASAAAS.  
.AA.SS.CC....S.A.SSA 
```

A- Adult already reserved  
C- Child already reserved  
S- Senior already reserved  
. - OPEN SEAT  

Be sure to place the file in the same location as the source code.
